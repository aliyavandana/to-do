# TODO App
This App is created to keep track of the tasks to be done/completed.
Used TypeScript for type checking, React-Hooks, Custom hooks, LocalStorage for data Persistance and react-testing-library

## Scope for Improvement
1. Pictographic representation of Tasks Done vs Tasks Pending
2. Calender integration with TODO list to effectively schedule the tasks
3. Leaderboard with Friend Challenges for completing the TODOs (Friends can be synced up with social media logins)
4. Timely reminders to email / notifications to phone to complete the Pending TODOs.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run test`

Test cases were implemented using react-testing-library.
Test cases for updating the todo list, toggling the list items and persisting the data after reloading are tested.
